<h1>🐍 Snake-Water-Gun Game 🎮</h1>
<br>
This is a basic Snake-Water-Gun game built using Python. It is a simple command-line game that randomly selects the computer's choice using the random.randint library and compares it with the player's input to determine the winner.

📌 About the Project
This is my first GitHub repository and a small project to get started with Git & Github.

The game follows the traditional Snake-Water-Gun rules:

🐍 Snake drinks Water → 🐍 wins

💧 Water drowns Gun → 💧 wins

🔫 Gun kills Snake → 🔫 wins

If both choose the same, it's a tie!
